# Techbridge-Konga-Clone
This is a clone of the Konga e-commerce website, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive homepage, product listings, details page, and a mock shopping cart. The project demonstrates my ability to replicate web designs and implement core e-commerce functionalities.
